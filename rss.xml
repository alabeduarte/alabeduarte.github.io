Got a new laptop and I have to setup everything… again…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always find exciting when I get something new, such as a new laptop. When
buying one, changing jobs (assuming the employer provides me one) or replacing
old by a new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I like to do is to assess the machine’s power, see what is made
of in terms of memory and disk space. Then, I see how far I can get in terms of
privileges (i.e. can I install/uninstall whatever I want?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important to me because I like to keep things clean and tidy so
eventually I can start making my own mess by installing my stuff. During my
career I kind of got a mental list of softwares I lean on, things that I really
need, other things that I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; need and others that I heard that are nice but
I never really used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I became to customise my settings more and more, &lt;em&gt;having a new machine wasn’t
that exciting anymore&lt;/em&gt;. I not only have to remember to install all of these
things that I need, it became also tedius and demanded a large cognitive effort.
Also I got frustated many times because I thought I was all setup until I
realised I forgot to install a particular tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistent environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I now approach this is to automate my setup as much as I can so that
every time I setup a new machine, my development environment will be consistent
each time. In order to make this happen, I like to structure my environment
setup with the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to go with an approach of running a single command and install everything
I need at once. The operational system that I’ve been using is macOS but most of
the things that I’ll mention here also applies for Linux. In terms of Windows,
probably you will find equivalent.  What is important here is to stick to the
concept of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I use to install the tools that I rely on is &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;
and it is simple as that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ brew install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The command above installs &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, as an exampe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install macOS apps (i.e. browser, code editor, image
visualisation, etc) via &lt;a href=&quot;https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/&quot;&gt;Homebrew Cask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ brew install --cask firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you install something via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; (a.k.a Homebrew), the software is now
managed by it. Meaning that whenever you need to upgrade, reinstall or delete,
you can do via homebrew as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ brew upgrade git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this is that you can now dump all your software list you
ever installed via brew into one file and that can be used to setup a whole new
machine with a single command. You can achieve that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle&quot;&gt;Homebrew
Bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle&quot;&gt;official
documentation&lt;/a&gt; to install it
properly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are all set, you can run the following command that will consolidate
all the things you have installed into a file usually named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Brewfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ brew bundle dump --file=Brewfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Brewfile&lt;/code&gt; will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tap &amp;quot;github/gh&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/bundle&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/cask&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/cask-fonts&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/cask-versions&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/core&amp;quot;
tap &amp;quot;homebrew/services&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;git&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;make&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;neovim&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;tmux&amp;quot;
brew &amp;quot;unzip&amp;quot;
cask &amp;quot;buttercup&amp;quot;
cask &amp;quot;docker&amp;quot;
cask &amp;quot;firefox&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine you do that now, save this file somewhere (i.e. cloud). When you
receive a new machine or even format your current machine, you can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew
bundle&lt;/code&gt; to restore all the software that you used to have. See the command
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ brew bundle --file=homebrew/Brewfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above will install everything as if you were running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew install git&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;brew install go&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have your stuff in place, there will be a “necessary” pain of
authenticating with most of them (i.e. your cloud storage, your music app). The
way I like to approach this is to get handy a password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: I usually use brew cask to install mine so I don’t have to install it
manually ever again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don’t have a password manager, I’d consider downloading one now,
here’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few options to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buttercup.pw&quot;&gt;Buttercup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This category is pretty much to make sure once you are all setup, your tools are
the way you left them before changing machines (or before you restored your
current machine). I personally don’t bother too much about browser config
because I have personal accounts that brings my config from the browser’s cloud,
but editor configuration is something that is really close to my workflow and if
I don’t see my editor or my terminal the way I remembered, I might have a
hardtime trying to remember where things were before becoming productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About code editors, you might have seen around some GitHub repo called
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt;. The reason for this name is because most of configs are files that
have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; in front of its name (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.vim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.idea&lt;/code&gt;,
etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what most people do, they create a git repository somewhere (i.e. GitHub,
GitLab, Bitbucket, etc) and consolidate all configs into one place so whenever
you clone your repo (from a brand-new machine), you can run a couple of commands
and have your original config in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can also add customisable scripts to speed up your initial
setting. As an example, VSCode is an editor that you can install a number of
plugins to support your day-to-day development. So, although I’m not a heavy
VSCode user, I use it sometimes and I have a few plugins that helps during these
occasions. So I came up with a script that will read all my current plugins and
store them into a file so whenever I setup a new environment, the script will
install all of these plugins so that when I open VSCode, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt;
will contain all plugins that I used to have in my previous environment. That’s
was pretty much inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle&quot;&gt;Homebrew Bundle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash

###
# Creates symbolic link from this dir into where vscode is installed
# then reads VSCodeExtensionsFile and install each extension one by one
###
bundle()
{
  # Creates symbolic link
  rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json || true
  ln -s `pwd`/vscode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json

  # Install extensions
  while read extension; do
    code --install-extension $extension
  done &amp;lt; vscode/VSCodeExtensionsFile

  echo &amp;quot;Done.&amp;quot;
}

###
# List vscode extensions and place into VSCodeExtensionsFile file
###
dump()
{
  extensions=&amp;quot;vscode/VSCodeExtensionsFile&amp;quot;
  echo &amp;quot;Reading existing extensions from VSCode onto $extensions&amp;quot;
  echo &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

  code --list-extensions | tee $extensions

  echo &amp;quot;Done.&amp;quot;
}

$*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Development’s process that was credited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kentbeck.com/&quot;&gt;Kent
Beck&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea consists of writing unit tests for
your program, making them fail, then introducing the minimum amount of code that
is enough to make the test pass, then you continue writing more tests according
to your requirements at hand. By having tests in place, any change you do on
your main code (let’s call it production code from now) can be checked against
those tests and running them for every new change can be a way to get faster
feedback, as an alternative to boot your application (whatever that is), run by
each scenario and check if things are working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD (Test-Driven Development) is one of many techniques for developing software
and this article aims to share my personal experience with it. I hope that I can
clarify my thoughts on &lt;strong&gt;when I believe it can help&lt;/strong&gt; and when I believe we
should take a step back. I need to say that &lt;strong&gt;I found TDD pretty difficult and
abstract at first&lt;/strong&gt;. There will always be a space for discussion and that’s why
other processes such as pair-programming and code review are extremely
complementary to what I consider healthy software development processes. Let me
give you some context before I start, so then you can understand better where I
came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started reading about TDD on the internet and what helped me the most in my
first steps were the articles from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.caelum.com.br&quot;&gt;Caelum&lt;/a&gt;
website. I found really nice examples of how to do it at the time through their
articles and further I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://alabeduarte.com/&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; which led me to
the formal definitions written by Kent Beck. Then I joined
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtworks.com&quot;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and there I believe it was
a turning point for me. ThoughtWorks is famous for its revolutionary mindset
(look for &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilemanifesto.org&quot;&gt;the agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar&quot;&gt;Tech
Radar&lt;/a&gt; publications and for caring about
code quality. However, the reason I believe working there was so important was
because of the people that I had a chance to work with at the time. They really
encouraged me to challenge the current state of the code and how it could be
improved. We also had a strong pair-programming culture which combined with
writing tests, challenging code maintainability became pretty natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do I believe TDD is important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test-Driven Development enables refactoring.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, having tests that exercise your code’s intention (function
or method) opens room for refactoring the code with stronger confidence. You can
move stuff around, you can rename things that express better what you are trying
to do, you can add an argument to a function or you can remove them all. If
after all of that you run your tests and they pass, chances are that you’ve done
everything right! The opposite is true as well. If you change things and after
running the tests some of them fail, it could be a sign that you’ve done
something wrong and needs to be fixed. While refactoring the code, if you notice
that one single change affects multiple tests, it could be a sign that the
coupling between components is high or the scope of the change/refactor is big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time, &lt;strong&gt;I learned that TDD is not about testing first necessarily&lt;/strong&gt;. The
process of writing tests first, seeing them fail to then make them pass to be
able to refactor really helps but the key factor to me was let the tests drive
how I think so that my scope of changes can be expressed in the tests. I might
want to refactor something, but if my scenarios are pretty small, I can postpone
this decision for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test-Driven Development favours design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDD is all about letting your tests guide you about the problem you need to
solve. It is pretty common to use the baby steps terminology here. Basically,
you will start with really small and basic scenarios (for a given input, I
expect this output). With that in mind, your code design should be simple enough
to satisfy the requirements. Another aspect that can contribute to better design
is that your test is the first consumer of your code. There you will call the
function that you carefully named and thoroughly added certain arguments and you
will see if that really expresses what you want to do. You may ask: “Should I
really pass 4 arguments in here?” “Is this name good?” “Isn’t too complicated to
set up the initial state for just testing if this does what it needs to do?” If
the answer to this question doesn’t feel quite right, you can use this
opportunity to change your code and look at your unit tests again and imagine:
“how will someone call this code in real life? Is it easy to read?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, “For a given input, I expect this output” is not possible.  You could
argue that it is not that simple as sometimes it is not easy to structure input
and expected output. However, The fact that might not be possible all times
doesn’t change the fact that you can always think about it and make it as an
exercise. Challenge yourself often and see if this is really the case. If not,
try breaking down your code into smaller components and then ask this question
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good code design is pretty subjective!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES! That is it! If I’m coding all by myself I’m pretty sure I’ll understand it
all and every decision will make sense until I have to explain to someone.
That’s how pair programming and/or code review becomes crucial here. The process
of doing TDD evolves empathy as well. I tend to think that we need to solve some
problems right away, but often when I share my thoughts with someone I realise
that I’m thinking too far ahead. Conversations like that can help you to avoid
overengineering and make decisions prematurely. As we know by now, our tests are
the first consumers of our code, so lean on that and discuss with your peers
whether this is really a good design. Here are some questions that I often try
to ask myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Is my code easy to maintain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Is my code easy to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Is my code easy to read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Is my code expressive enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TDD doesn’t mean bug-free code!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard an argument before saying that if you’re doing TDD, your code
shouldn’t have bugs. Well, I believe this is a bold statement. Of course, my
code can have bugs. Test-Driven Development is a technique that requires
discipline and experience. If I don’t follow the steps, for example, if I never
see my tests failing, I can fall into the false positive trap. It is crucial to
write a test, see it fail, then make it pass! The tests should also be reliable.
Is part of the good design I mentioned above that our tests are also easy to
read and maintain. They should be predictable and clean. If there are too many
dependencies or setups, it could be a sign that my code is too coupled,
therefore, it will be hard to maintain and false positives can be introduced.
Besides, at this stage, you could argue if having tests is really adding value
given the amount of setup that it might require if you come to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another aspect to it, which is: we still can write tons of unit tests
following all the rules, but with the wrong assumptions. If we don’t understand
the problem we are trying to solve, we will end up having tests that will
exercise something that doesn’t make sense with tests passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tooling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous sections, I’ve described techniques, beliefs and discipline. To
make it stick and be pleasant, we need to have good tooling. The tests should be
fast to run. It should be quicker to run a test than open the application (i.e.
browser or mobile device) myself and test it out. While coding, it should be
quick to trigger the tests as well. Nowadays, most programming languages’
ecosystems contain some tool where it watches your code and whenever you save a
file, the tests relevant to that file will run. That is the sweet spot, in my
opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final thoughts and when doing TDD doesn’t help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Test-Driven Development doesn’t help when we are not quite
certain about what to do and what to expect. Sometimes, you might not be
familiar with the language, framework or platform and you might need some time
to play around with the available APIs and see what it is possible and what can
be a constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the expected outcome might be unknown, having the development guided by tests
can be extremely difficult since TDD is all about defining the expectations and
figuring out how to meet them. So what usually works well for me is to do quick
experiments, writing code with no tests at all, see what can be done, explore
the limits of the tool/platform/API and then restart with TDD mindset using the
experiments as a reference/documentation. After that, I can safely throw the
experiment away and continue with the new code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this might not work for everyone, but as I mentioned a few times, it
is all about the exercise. If you try to do that, you might learn a thing or two
and next time you will perform better. All I want is the short feedback and the
ability to iterate over my understanding of the problem at hand often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Engineer since 2007, my professional career has given me a
great experience building applications in many different languages and domains
spanning health, energy/oil/gas, media and retail. I am a quality-focused
engineer with over 5 years of experience leading technical teams of 10+
including coaching and mentoring offshore teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and functional
programming paradigms applied with extensive experience on test-driven
development (TDD) and pair programming techniques. I have delivered production
applications in many different languages and platforms including Go, Elixir,
Ruby, Javascript/Typescript, Scala, Java, Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in transparency, servant leadership and constant — two-way —
feedback. I’m constantly challenging user’s value and scope and I feel pretty
excited about social impact. I also believe that people can do amazing things
given the right opportunity, and I also believe that opportunities can be
created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy speaking/attending conferences, coaching, sharing knowledge and
contributing back to the software community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways of working: I have led a number of programs on the path of continuous
delivery, with a focus on technical capability uplift and the realisation of
benefits including shorter cycle time of features released to end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself an easy-going person. I tend to avoid challenging the status
quo without building a rapport around the environment and I try to listen and
learn how things work first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate knowledge sharing, thoughtful code reviews and pair programming. I
wouldn’t be so confident and happy about my career if I didn’t have the input
from the people that I had the chance to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to apply TDD whenever is possible and I try to keep my changes small. I
also believe in discipline and code that favours the ability to refactor and
good design. I understand that good design is subjective, so I tend to ask some
key questions while I’m coding, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my code easy to maintain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my code easy to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my code easy to read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my code expressive enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing code review, I tend to be flexible by encouraging follow-up PRs to
address minor changes so that features can be unblocked as smaller PRs are being
shipped. That also means a smaller scope of changes and fewer risks of breaking
things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
