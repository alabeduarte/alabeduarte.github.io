I am a quality-focused\nengineer with over 5 years of experience leading technical teams of 10+\nincluding coaching and mentoring offshore teams.</p>\n<p>I have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and functional\nprogramming paradigms applied with extensive experience on test-driven\ndevelopment (TDD) and pair programming techniques. I have delivered production\napplications in many different languages and platforms including Go, Elixir,\nRuby, Javascript/Typescript, Scala, Java, Android and iOS.</p>\n<h2>Values</h2>\n<p>I believe in transparency, servant leadership and constant — two-way —\nfeedback. I’m constantly challenging user’s value and scope and I feel pretty\nexcited about social impact. I also believe that people can do amazing things\ngiven the right opportunity, and I also believe that opportunities can be\ncreated.</p>\n<p>I also enjoy speaking/attending conferences, coaching, sharing knowledge and\ncontributing back to the software community.</p>\n<p>Ways of working: I have led a number of programs on the path of continuous\ndelivery, with a focus on technical capability uplift and the realisation of\nbenefits including shorter cycle time of features released to end-users.</p>\n<p>I consider myself an easy-going person. I tend to avoid challenging the status\nquo without building a rapport around the environment and I try to listen and\nlearn how things work first.</p>\n<p>I appreciate knowledge sharing, thoughtful code reviews and pair programming. I\nwouldn’t be so confident and happy about my career if I didn’t have the input\nfrom the people that I had the chance to work with.</p>\n<p>I like to apply TDD whenever is possible and I try to keep my changes small. I\nalso believe in discipline and code that favours the ability to refactor and\ngood design. I understand that good design is subjective, so I tend to ask some\nkey questions while I’m coding, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is my code easy to maintain?</li>\n<li>Is my code easy to change?</li>\n<li>Is my code easy to read?</li>\n<li>Is my code expressive enough?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When doing code review, I tend to be flexible by encouraging follow-up PRs to\naddress minor changes so that features can be unblocked as smaller PRs are being\nshipped. That also means a smaller scope of changes and fewer risks of breaking\nthings.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":"January 01, 2021","description":"Introduction about who I am, my background and the values I try to stand by."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/this-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"This Blog"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"752baae7-3660-5079-bb7b-fe512de8d2ea","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"b06a3354-8dfe-5aaa-a519-c098cc499448"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3347749741","3716405767"]}
