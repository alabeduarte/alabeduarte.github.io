For example, if I want to assess how aligned\nwe all are with regards to the role each one of us has to play in the Software\nDevelopment, how can I discuss that if all I have is “What worked”, “What didn’t\nwork”, etc?</p>\n<p>In our team, there are a quite diverse number of roles, which is actually true\nin most of Software Development teams nowadays. We have people that are more\nfocused on the product direction, people that are looking into how the user\nexperience should be and Software Developers/Engineers like myself.</p>\n<h2>How the activity went out</h2>\n<p>The retrospective was divided into 2 steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bullet point gathering from each participant and then, translated them into\nsticky notes trying to form a timeline from the <strong>Idea</strong> to <strong>Working Software</strong>.</li>\n<li>Asked the participants to fill out the <strong>Roles and Expectations</strong> matrix\nbased on the bullet points above.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>First step: bullet points from Idea to Software lifecycle</h4>\n<p>The first step was to gather bullet points from everyoneasking <strong>what are the\nsteps to deliver a software, starting from the idea until the actual software in\nthe hands of a customer</strong>.</p>\n<p>I wanted to avoid any kind of bias, so I did this <strong>anonymously</strong>.  Once I had\nall the data from everyone, I’ve added sticky notes to represent the different\nsteps provided by everyone in some sort of timeline.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/1843f/retro-step-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 28.48101265822785%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"From Idea to Software lifecycle\"\n        title=\"From Idea to Software lifecycle\"\n        src=\"/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/f058b/retro-step-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/c26ae/retro-step-1.png 158w,\n/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/6bdcf/retro-step-1.png 315w,\n/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/f058b/retro-step-1.png 630w,\n/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/40601/retro-step-1.png 945w,\n/static/60a56c968bddc261b2f8521a3c83d421/1843f/retro-step-1.png 1186w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h4>Second step: fill out the “Roles and Expectations” matrix</h4>\n<p>The second step was to discuss more in-depth roles and expectations. To do that,\nwe created a matrix where the number of rows represents the many roles we wanted\nto discuss and two columns saying <strong>“I expect that…”</strong> and <strong>“I don’t expect\nthat…”</strong>.

I also asked the participants to avoid the use of “+1” or any kind\nof emoji that would make others biased. The idea here was to have equal weight\nfor every sticky note since we would have a <strong>separate</strong> moment for voting on\nthe themes that we wanted to discuss and then, <strong>“+1“‘s</strong> would be\nappropriate.</p>\n<h4>No action items, for now…</h4>\n<p>It is usually expected that <strong>“Action Items”</strong> should be one of the outcomes\nfrom retrospectives and who owns these action items. For this retro though, I\nwanted to focus on the <strong>discussion</strong> instead of focusing on action items.</p>\n<p>I’ve planned having 45 minutes just debating the “Roles and Expectations” sticky\nnotes, appreciating <strong>how different views we might have in the team about the\ncertain role and how we can agree on something together</strong>. With that, I tried to\nhave 10 minutes time slot for the top voters, trying to cover as many roles as\npossible.</p>\n<h3>Takeaways from this particular retro</h3>\n<p>I’ve got feedback from the participants that the retro was quite insightful,\nwhich inspired me to write this post. On the occasion of this particular retro,\nas it might occur with many, there were some loose ends; <strong>we couldn’t figure\neverything out in one go</strong>. However, I believe we had an opportunity to speak\nfreely about what things some believed that a Software Engineer <strong>should not\ndo</strong>, for example, and appreciate that different people thought exactly opposite\nthings.</p>\n<h2>Thank you for reading</h2>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this post, if you have any feedback or questions, hit me up on\n<a href=\"mailto:alabeduarte@gmail.com\">alabeduarte@gmail.com</a>, I’d be happy to hear your thoughts and be better next\ntime!</p>\n<p><em>All the images were generated from <a href=\"https://excalidraw.com/\">excalidraw.com</a></em></p>\n<h3>Other References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-au/insights/blog/5-things-you-need-know-facilitate-retrospective#:~:text=A%20Retrospective%20is%20a%20ceremony,evaluate%20its%20past%20working%20cycle.&#x26;text=Finally%2C%20retrospective%20is%20a%20moment,improve%20things%20identified%20as%20negative.\">Retrospective\nCeremony</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.funretrospectives.com/role-expectations-matrix/\">Role Expectations\nMatrix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.funretrospectives.com/is-is-not-does-does-not/\">Is - Is not - Does - Does\nnot</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Retrospectives - Roles and Expectations","date":"December 11, 2021","description":" Recently I had the opportunity to run a retrospective ceremony focused on Roles and Expectations.
