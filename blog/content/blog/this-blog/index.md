description: "The structure of this blog"
---

I've had some opportunities to write technical blogs and documentation
throughout my career (in the context of my day-to-day job) but I always deferred
the moment to atually write my own stuff, my own experiences you know?

Now, I'm finally ready â€“ I guess. The idea is document and share my learnings so
that we (you, dear reader, and myself) can come back later and check things out.

I hope you enjoy the posts and I'd love to get some feedback. To do so, feel
free to contact me via email: alabeduarte@gmail.com.
