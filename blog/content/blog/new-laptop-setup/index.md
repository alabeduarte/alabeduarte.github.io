## Just got a new laptop, great!

I always find exciting when I get something new, such as a new laptop. When
buying one, changing jobs (when the employer provides me one) or replacing old
by a new.

The first thing I like to do is to assess the machine's power, see what is made
of in terms of memory and disk space. Then, I see how far I can get in terms of
privileges (i.e. can I install/uninstall whatever I want?).

This is important to me because I like to keep things clean and then make my own
mess, installing my stuff. During my career I kind of got a mental list of
softwares I lean on, things that I really need, other things that I _might_ need
and others that I heard that are nice but I never really used it.

For some of the situations I described above, it is inevitable that you'll need
to install your tools and it can be exciting, depending on the person. However,
sometimes your computer just breaks and you have to setup a new one and that is
pretty inconvenient.

On this post I'll share what I have larned and hopefully it can be useful to you
or future me. Many things that I learned were trying and error but also many
things were learned from friends and co-workers and I'll reference some of them
at the bottom of this post so please, make sure to give them a shout out if you
have a chance!

## Just got a new laptop, dang!

As I mentionend in the beginning, I ran by multiple iterations of manually
installing softwares that I liked and also keep tracking either mentally or
somewhere in the _cloud_ the softwares that I needed it. When I say software I'm
not only talking about applications such as browser, cloud storage (i.e.
dropbox, google sync, iCloud, etc), slack. I'm
also talking about command line interfaces, programming languages, look'n feel
for my editor, plugins, etc.

As I became to customise my setting smore and more, having a new machine wasn't
that exciting anymore. I not only have to remember to install all of these
things that I need, it became also tedius and demanded a large cognitive effort.
Also I got frustated many times because I thought I was all setup until I
realised I forgot to install a particular tool.

## Consistent environment
