## Background
Software Engineer since 2007, my professional career has given me a
great experience building applications in many different languages and domains
spanning health, energy/oil/gas, media and retail. I am a quality-focused
engineer with over 5 years of experience leading technical teams of 10+
including coaching and mentoring offshore teams.

I have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming and functional
programming paradigms applied with extensive experience on test-driven
development (TDD) and pair programming techniques. I have delivered production
applications in many different languages and platforms including Go, Elixir,
Ruby, Javascript/Typescript, Scala, Java, Android and iOS.

## Values
I believe in transparency, servant leadership and constant — two-way —
feedback. I’m constantly challenging user’s value and scope and I feel pretty
excited about social impact. I also believe that people can do amazing things
given the right opportunity, and I also believe that opportunities can be
created.

I also enjoy speaking/attending conferences, coaching, sharing knowledge and
contributing back to the software community.

Ways of working: I have led a number of programs on the path of continuous
delivery, with a focus on technical capability uplift and the realisation of
benefits including shorter cycle time of features released to end-users.

I consider myself an easy-going person. I tend to avoid challenging the status
quo without building a rapport around the environment and I try to listen and
learn how things work first.

I appreciate knowledge sharing, thoughtful code reviews and pair programming. I
wouldn’t be so confident and happy about my career if I didn’t have the input
from the people that I had the chance to work with.

I like to apply TDD whenever is possible and I try to keep my changes small. I
also believe in discipline and code that favours the ability to refactor and
good design. I understand that good design is subjective, so I tend to ask some
key questions while I’m coding, such as:
* Is my code easy to maintain?
* Is my code easy to change?
* Is my code easy to read?
* Is my code expressive enough?

When doing code review, I tend to be flexible by encouraging follow-up PRs to
address minor changes so that features can be unblocked as smaller PRs are being
shipped. That also means a smaller scope of changes and fewer risks of breaking
things.
